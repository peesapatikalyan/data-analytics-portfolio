Credit Score Prediction â€“ Project Summary

Project Overview:
This project aimed to predict the creditworthiness of individuals using supervised machine learning models.
Both CART and Random Forest models were trained using financial and demographic features to determine risk of loan default.

Tools and Technologies:
R (rpart, randomForest, caret), Python (sklearn), Excel, SQL (simulated data queries)

Key Outcomes:
- Random Forest improved predictive accuracy over CART
- Identified key risk factors: income, credit history, age
- Demonstrated ability to apply ML for risk scoring and reporting

Notes:
This is a simulated academic project created for demonstration purposes in a business analytics portfolio.
